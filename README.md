These are algorithm exercises that I do regularly, just to be in shape.

I come from a generation where interviews were based primarily on tech questions,
certification like (do you know X language, Y RDBMS, Z appserver, etc). Industry
has changed dramatically, and big players have moved the focus to a radically
different arena: mathematical thinking, in particular, algorithmic thinking.
At the beginning I had a very hard time trying to solve these questions, given
that I saw the required tools at school a couple of decades back. Not to mention
that my jobs so far, did not give me much practice for those tools. We could say
that I started officially at the beginning of 2017, and since then I am becoming
better at solving these problems. It is a very gradual process, but I am confi-
dent that at some point I will master this area. My final goal is to compete at
the international arena and show myself that, with perseverance, I can do
anything that I want (even if it seemed quite hard at the beginning).

I mostly code in Python due its brevity and elegance, but switch to Java when
I need a more sophisticated data structure (out of the box). It is pity that
Python standard library lacks many of the nice things you can find under
the popular java.util.*

The repo is named after the first site I used (topcoder.com's SRMs), though
today I mostly use leetcode.com. Specially the questions for companies like
G(oogle), A(mazon) and similar. You can jump into that section with link below:

At the beginning of times, I tended to backup all my solutions; even the ones
that did not really work. But nowadays, I tend to prune a bit and just backup
here the ones that I find more interesting.

You will also find that old exercises lack documentation, but I am doing an
effort to explain the rationale for new ones. If you want to read the problem
description, please use the link template below:

https://leetcode.com/problems/<subdir-name>

where <subdir-name> can be replaced by the particular subdirectory you are
looking at (there may be several levels of grouping, but the subdirectory I am
referring to here is the bottom level; the one containing the code).

Long life to algorithm problems ...
