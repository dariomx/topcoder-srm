These are algorithm exercises that I do regularly, just to be in shape. You
never know when you will need to interview again, life is unpredictable ;-<

I come from a generation where interviews were based primarily on tech questions,
certification like (do you know language X? RDBMS Y? Appserver Z? etc). Industry
has changed dramatically, and big players have moved the focus to a radically
different arena: mathematical thinking, in particular, algorithmic thinking.
At the beginning I had a very hard time trying to solve these questions, given
that I saw the required tools at school a couple of decades back. Not to mention
that the first 17+ years of my experience, did not give me much practice about
these type of problems.  

We could say that, I started officially with algorithm problems at the beginning 
of 2017, and since then I am becoming better at solving them; 
it is a very gradual process. I mostly used Python3 for my solutions up
to 3rd pass (and a bit of Java), then moved to Rust in 4th pass.

All the solutions that I post here are mine, and the few exceptions will 
explicitly mention where I took them from. I think it has more value to present
my own creations, that just to mirror what others did; even if I do not always 
come with the best solution. I always check, however, what are the editorial 
and other's solutions, after I finish my own approach. There are some 
really amazing minds out there! The degree of sophistication and elegance of
their solutions is quite remarkable, looking forward to become one of them.
Time to time, I dare to post my own solutions in those forums; but only when
I am really proud of my version, or when I consider it represents original work.

The repo is named after the first site I used (topcoder.com's SRMs), though
today I mostly use leetcode.com. Specially the questions for companies like
Google, Facebook and similar. You can jump into that section with link below:

At the beginning of times, I tended to backup all my solutions; even the ones
that did not really work. But nowadays, I tend to prune a bit and just keep
the ones that I find more interesting. I have gone over some of the 
problems more than once (after several months you forget what you did);
this will get reflected on the subdirectory names (eg first-pass, snd-pass, etc).

You will also find that only a few solutions contain an explanation, sorry about
that. I put a lot of attention though, to code clarity and even elegance; so
perhaps just by reading the code you can grasp it. If you want to read the problem
description, please use the link template below:

https://leetcode.com/problems/[subdir-name]

where [subdir-name] can be replaced by the particular subdirectory you are
looking at (there may be several layers of directories, but the 
subdirectory I am
referring to here is the bottom level; the one containing the code). Newest 
solutions also name the file itself, not just the directory, after the problem;
so those should be even easier to link with original problem description
 at leetcode.com

Long life to algorithm problems and discrete math ...
