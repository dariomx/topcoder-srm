i confess having left the query service to the end,
and by this time i am quite tired; hence i simply
looked for something already working and copied the
scheme (just adjusting a few pieces).

the technique for doing pagination with ndb queries
was taken from:

https://github.com/zdenulo/gae-ndb-pagination

so main credit of this module goes to Zdenko Hrcek
